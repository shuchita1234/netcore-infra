This Terraform project is designed to automate the infrastructure provisioning for .NET Core applications. 
It includes configuration files to deploy Azure resources reliably and consistently. 
As a part of best practices, the project also sets up an Azure Storage Account to securely store the Terraform state file remotely, enabling collaboration and preventing state file conflicts.
